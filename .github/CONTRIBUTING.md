# Contribution Guidelines

First, thanks. Secondly, and ironically, there is not much here yet. If you have any suggestions for how to improve this repository, please open an issue or a pull request.

If you have examples of great contributing docs, open a new PR with them. Please use this format:

`- [Name](link) _Comment on why it is awesome._ - [@YourName](https://github.com/YourName)`.

Also:

- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Please add the entry in the correct section, in alphabetical order.
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title.
- Pull Requests without a personal comment will not be accepted until one is added.

Thank you!
